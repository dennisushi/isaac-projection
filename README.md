# Demo for Projective Geometry in IsaacSim

Sample util functions for projection of a pinhole camera pixel UV to world frame XYZ, and vice versa.

Specific to IsaacSim since (i) the depth input is inversed, i.e. `(1/depth)`, (ii) it uses the ViewProjection matrix, (iii) the camera axes are permuted and (iv) the pinhole camera is using a frensel model with near-far limits.

[TODO] Add demo files.
